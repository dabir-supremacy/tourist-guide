# tourist-guide
An implementation of Graph Data Structure in C++

In this solution, imagine yourself as a tourist guide. 

The task of the tourist guide is to move around the tourists while using minimum resources. In this
problem a tourist guide needs to take some tourists from one city to another. The cities are inter-
connected with a road network. For each pair of neighboring cities there is a bus service that runs
only between those two cities and uses the road that directly connects them. Each bus service has
a limit on the maximum number of passengers it can carry. He cannot drop any passenger in the
midway. Due to this, the tourist guide knows that some cities would require making extra trips if
the number of tourists are more than seating capacity. For example, consider the following road
map of 7 cities shown in figure given below. The edges connecting the cities represent the roads
and the number written on each edge indicates the passenger limit of the bus service that runs on
that road. To take 99 tourists from city 1 to city 7, he will require at least 4 trips, and the route he
would take is: 1 - 2 - 4 - 7.

Phase 1:

Representing the road map using an Adjacency Matrix

Phase 2:

Developing a cpp solution to the Tourist Problem shown above.
